# GizmoSceneFrancoisMartinage

I assumed that in order to get the "default" SceneGizmoAsset to inspect in the window i'll choose the one at a default path. The field is exposed so the user will be able to select the SceneGizmoAsset of his choice.

I made one change to SceneGizmoAsset to have an access to the gizmos list by creating a property that expose the private field.

Undo menu button is not working, not enough time to finish it.
